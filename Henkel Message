My name is Henwa and I am working in the Cyber Defense Management team. As part of our tasks, we monitor the internet to see if information connected to Henkel has been leaked.
 
6 GitHub repository detected openly accessible code for a Henkel enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, utilizing the software Tally.ERP 9. The code is stored on six publicly accessible repositories. A JSON file that also notably contains credentials for the address admin@henkel.com, likely for the ERP system and/or its associated SQL database. This is a critical info that can be used by attackers against us if the application will be used by Henkel.
 
Below is the repository url:
https://github.com/rock108/tally_exporter
https://github.com/rock108/henkel_service
https://github.com/rock108/logindemo
https://github.com/rock108/henkel_erp
https://github.com/rock108/imageapp
https://github.com/rock108/henkelUI

Can you please confirm whether sensitive Henkel data has been published on the repositories? And what are the information/data type concerning Henkel does this code use ?

Also, please set the repository to private since it reference Henkel. As continued exposure of the repositoriesâ€™ contents could lead to the further leakage of information that is sensitive to Henkel and can be used as cyber attacks

please reach out to me on henwa.gouda@henkel.com
